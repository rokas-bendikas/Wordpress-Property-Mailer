# Wordpress-Property-Mailer

A simple WORDPRESS API allowing to manage multiple real-estate properties.
The API has two main functions:

1. Sending schedule emails with available and soon-to-be-available properties to the pre-set mailing list. 
The newsletter gets sent periodically based on the frequency set in the admin menu.

2. Sweeping through the database daily and reminding internal managers about the property that is soon to be empty.
